create random weights using math.random //
compute the weighhts * points coordinate product (guess) //
desired value is the comparison that gives where the point is located wrt to the line by substituing the points in the line equation //
if the guess is not equal to the desired value, then the weights are adjusted/TRAINED till the desired is equal to the guess value
desired = the point is located wrt to the line by substituing the points in the line equation
if the guess = desired ====> stop

output is to be determined by the percepton

all the points are black by default

the loop should create array/json array that specifies what color the point should be
